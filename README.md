# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

A simple Frogger-style arcade game built using Python and the Turtle graphics module.

This game challenges the player to guide a turtle safely across a busy road full of moving cars. Each successful crossing increases the level and game speed.

## 🎮 Features

- Player-controlled turtle using the arrow key  
- Randomly generated cars in various colors and positions  
- Level system: each level increases car speed  
- Collision detection ends the game with a "Game Over" message  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design for modular and readable code

---

## 🧠 Concepts Reinforced

- Classes and Inheritance  
- Method Overriding  
- Game Loops with `time.sleep()` and `screen.update()`  
- List management and dynamic object creation  
- Collision detection  
- Event listeners (`onkey` and `listen`)
